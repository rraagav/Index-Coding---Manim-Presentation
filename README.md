## Index Coding with Side Information: A Visual and Analytical Explanation
Project Overview
This project provides a detailed analysis and explanation of the research paper titled "Index Coding with Side Information" by Ziv Bar-Yossef, Yitzhak Birk, T. S. Jayram, and Tomer Kol. Utilizing the Manim library in Python, we have created a video that visually highlights the key concepts of the paper. Additionally, we recorded a video where we explain the project using a PowerPoint presentation and our own analogies to make the content more accessible.
